# [Hingake](https://hingake.vercel.app)

Simplest PWA to allow people breath, relax & meditate.

## Run locally

Just clone the repo, install dependencies and run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

Project bootstrapped with [Preact CLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md), so you can use all the features of CLI.

### CLI Commands

- `npm install`: Installs dependencies

- `npm run dev`: Run a development, HMR server

- `npm run serve`: Run a production-like server

- `npm run build`: Production-ready build

- `npm run lint`: Pass TypeScript files using TSLint

- `npm run test`: Run Jest and Enzyme with
  [`enzyme-adapter-preact-pure`](https://github.com/preactjs/enzyme-adapter-preact-pure) for
  your tests
