# [Breathing App](https://breathing-app-six.vercel.app)

The simplest web application that does just one basic thing â€” helps using the [4:7:8 breathing technique](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324417). Once you have installed it, start the session, adapt your breathing to the rhythm, and relax.
